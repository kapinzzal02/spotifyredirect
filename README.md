### A no-nonsense way of redirecting Spotify links to open in the Desktop app instead of the god-awful Web Player.

### Installation

1. Enable Developer Mode in your browser's Extension settings.
2. Load the unpacked extension by selecting the directory it is in.
3. Ensure it has the necessary permissions.

In a future update, I'll try to disable the pop-up that shows up every time you click a link, before the link actually redirects into the app.
